% DESCRIPTION:	    Just an equation in LaTeX. The goal is to turn this into
%                   a png. For future reference, these are the commands I used
%                   to generate a .png with this document:
%
%                       pdflatex <docname>.tex
%                       pdfcrop -margin 3 <docname>.pdf <out-name>.pdf
%                       convert -trim -density 200 <out-name>.pdf <out-name>.png
